            <h2>Reckless Love - Cory Asbury</h2>
            <p>Before I spoke a word<br>
                You were sing over me<br>
                You have been so, so good to me<br>
                Before I took a breath<br>
                You breathed your life in me<br>
                You have been so, so kind to me<br>
                <br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
                Reckless love of God<br>
                It chases me down<br>
                Fight 'til I'm found<br>
                Leaves the ninety-nine<br>
                I couldn't earn it<br>
                I don't deserve it<br>
                Still you give yourself away<br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
                Reckless love of God<br>
                <br>
                When I was your foe, still your love fought for me<br>
                You have been so, so good to me<br>
                When I felt no worth<br>
                You paid it all for me<br>
                You have been so, so kind to me<br>
                <br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
                Reckless love of God<br>
                It chases me down<br>
                Fight 'til I'm found<br>
                Leaves the ninety-nine<br>
                I couldn't earn it<br>
                I don't deserve it<br>
                Still you give yourself away<br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
                Reckless love of God<br>
                <br>
                There's no shadow you won't light up<br>
                Mountain you won't climb up<br>
                Coming after me<br>
                <br>
                There's no wall you won't kick down<br>
                No lie you won't tear down<br>
                Coming after me<br>
                <br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
                Reckless love of God<br>
                It chases me down<br>
                Fight 'til I'm found<br>
                Leaves the ninety-nine<br>
                I couldn't earn it<br>
                I don't deserve it<br>
                Still you give yourself away<br>
                Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending<br>
